						<span class="preview">In this project, I turned a lackluster and intuitive design into a polished, well-thought-out interface. I kept the layout and type simple and usable while adding some nuance here and there with small amounts of dropshadow and shading to make elements like headers and buttons stand out. I also created the background for the site and aided in the design of the logo.</span>

						<span class="preview">I did some work on a medical billing and coding site. In addition to refining the article design and stylizing the monetization for the site, I designed this job board. Unfortunately it has not yet been implemented, but the mock-ups give good sense of how it would work. As you can see, I placed hover states next to some of the inactive buttons.</span>

						<span class="preview">I was given images and content that corresponded to each slide. The project was a very open-ended, "design a slideshow." I decided to model the design based on the appearance of a timeline, since the slideshow content was very time-focused ("Today's University Is" and "Tomorrow's University Will Be").</span>

						<span class="preview">For this project, I redesigned a finance website and its logo. One unique challenge to this project was that the site had a lot of repeat traffic, so my goal was to make the redesign look as good as possible without disrupting the experience of long-time users. Most of the changes I made were typography and white space. I also created pull-quotes and a Q&amp;A format to give the articles a sharper, more polished look. </span>
